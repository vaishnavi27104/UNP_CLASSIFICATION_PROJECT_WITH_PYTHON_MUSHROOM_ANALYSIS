# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_MUSHROOM_ANALYSIS

This project was completed as part of my internship with UNP Education and focuses on classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using machine learning in Python. The process involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The goal was to identify key features influencing mushroom edibility and build an accurate predictive model that helps in distinguishing safe mushrooms from toxic ones. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to ensure reliable classification results.
